# Program gives the correct distance in edge cases (e.g. route starts and ends at the same stop, route starts or ends at Park Street)

# Stops and lines can be added, removed, or rearranged in your code without making any changes to the route-finding logic (within reason â€“ every line must intersect at a single common stop)

# Repository has several logical commits with descriptive messages

# Code uses correct indentation/style and descriptive variable names
