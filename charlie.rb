# # Program has the subway system defined with appropriate data structures
# # Program can find the distance between two stops on the same line
# # Program can find the distance between two stops on different lines
# # Program gives the correct distance in edge cases (e.g. route starts and ends at the same stop, route starts or ends at Park Street)
# # Stops and lines can be added, removed, or rearranged in your code without making any changes to the route-finding logic (within reason â€“ every line must intersect at a single common stop)
# # Repository has several logical commits with descriptive messages
# # Code uses correct indentation/style and descriptive variable names

# Given this subway system, write a Ruby program that prompts the user for an "origin" stop and a "destination" stop, and tells them the number of stops they would have to make on that journey. For instance, traveling from Central to Copley would be 5 stops.

# Hint: Prompt the user for four separate pieces of data: origin line, origin stop, destination line, and destination stop.
