#Given this subway system, write a Ruby program that prompts
#the user for an "origin" stop and a "destination" stop,
#and tells them the number of stops they would have to make
#on that journey. For instance, traveling from Central to Copley would
#be 5 stops.

#(2) Program has the subway system defined with appropriate data structures
#(1) Program can find the distance between two stops on the same line
#(2) Program can find the distance between two stops on different lines
#(1) Program gives the correct distance in edge cases (e.g. route starts and
  # ends at the same stop, route starts or ends at Park Street)
#(1) Stops and lines can be added, removed, or rearranged in your code without
# making any changes to the route-finding logic (within reason â€“ every line
  # must intersect at a single common stop)
#(1) Repository has several logical commits with descriptive messages
#(2) Code uses correct indentation/style and descriptive variable names


#Bonus:
#(1) Add methods to your madness!
# We haven't fully covered defining your own methods yet,
# and technically none are required for this assignment.
# However, you might have noticed some places in your code that
# are doing the same thing multiple times, but with slightly different data.
# Introduce a method or two to resolve this duplication.
